# desert-zombie
This repository is for the single player Quake map, titled Sokushinbutsu. In it, the player explores a dangerous statue with a temple inside. See my process journal in the [project wiki](https://github.com/fatjosephina/desert-zombie/wiki)!
Edit: Due to a statue being too time-consuming to create in Trenchbroom, I have decided to change the concept to a temple that is not inside a statue.
